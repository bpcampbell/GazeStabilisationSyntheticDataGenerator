# GazeStabilisationSyntheticDataGenerator
GazeStabilisationSyntheticDataGenerator contains a matlab script "generate_data.m" and a simulink file "fly_gaze_sim.slx". 
It was written for Control Systems Workshop for SOAR/BISCIT March 2023 to generate synthetic data based on Schwyn et al 2011.

In order to run you must download the code. Create a folder in the working directory called "Data". Open the simulink file, and run the script.
